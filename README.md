# Arctic Survival
 
In this snowy-themed game, players are presented with a platform consisting of 3x3 squares. The objective is to rescue the trapped polar bear at the end of the platform, but players must avoid hidden traps that are scattered throughout the squares. At the start of the game, the locations of the traps are revealed to players, but they become hidden once the game begins. If a player successfully navigates the platform without stepping on any traps, they will save the polar bear and advance to the next stage. If a player steps on a trap, the game will restart.
